I also cloned the repo and set up the intellij project. |

Afterwards, I realized that using a 2D array would allow me to eliminate duplicate recursive calls. |

I pass all test cases. |
| 2/6  | 11:15-11:45 | I realized that my first approach exactly matched with memoization. I then started coding tabulation and realized I could make it 1D. For each coin, I iterate through my dynamic programming array and subtract the coin value from its index. Then I add the ways to make this previous value to the new value with the coin. I pass all tests. |
