| 1/28 | 11:25-11:55 |         I drew a tree on the board of an algorithm I had thought of and worked through how to avoid repetitions. Afterwards, I realized that using a 2D array would allow me to eliminate duplicate recursive calls. |
| 1/31 | 10:40-11:10 | I coded my recursive approach, changing it a bit by popping coins off the end of the array by using keeping track of an index starting at the length of the coins array and subtracting by 1. I pass all test cases. |
